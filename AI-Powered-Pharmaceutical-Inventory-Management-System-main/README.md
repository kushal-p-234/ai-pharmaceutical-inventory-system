# 💊 AI-Powered Pharmaceutical Inventory Management System

A high-performance, cloud-optimized pharmaceutical inventory system. This application is specifically engineered for fast deployment on free tiers (Streamlit Cloud, Vercel) while maintaining sophisticated AI capabilities like demand forecasting, anomaly detection, and automated stock optimization.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **⚡ Ultra-Fast Startup**: Implements "Invisible Lazy Loading" for heavy ML libraries (TensorFlow, Scikit-learn), allowing the app to boot instantly on restricted hardware.
*   **🤖 Advanced AI Forecasting**: Predict future stock consumption using **Random Forest** and **LSTM Neural Networks** with automatic seasonal decomposition.
*   **📊 Comprehensive Analytics**:
    *   **Consumption Trends**: Visualize historical usage and projected needs.
    *   **Wastage Analysis**: Track expired items and potential financial losses.
    *   **Cost Optimization**: Automated EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) calculations to reduce holding costs.
    *   **Anomaly Monitor**: Real-time detection of unusual inventory fluctuations.
*   **💬 Pharma AI Assistant**: An intelligent chatbot integrated with your inventory data for instant queries and recommendations.
*   **⏰ Expiry & Alerts**: Proactive monitoring of stock levels and approaching expiry dates with customizable urgency levels.
*   **📄 Professional Reporting**: Generate detailed PDF and CSV reports for inventory audits and financial reviews.
*   **📱 QR Code Integration**: Quick scanning and generation of QR codes for efficient product tracking.

## 🛠️ Optimized Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: Streamlit (High-Performance UI)
*   **Database**: SQLite (Relational Storage)
*   **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow/Keras (Deep Learning), Scikit-learn (Random Forest, Regression)
*   **Data Science**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy
*   **Visualizations**: Plotly (Interactive Charts)
*   **Security**: Self-signed SSL support for local development
